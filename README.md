This provides consolidated random number generation tools that ensure there will be no accidental
usage of the system random number generator. It wraps [thi.ng/random](https://thi.ng/random) and
[simplex-noise](https://github.com/jwagner/simplex-noise.js).

I made this because I learned the hard way that I needed it.
