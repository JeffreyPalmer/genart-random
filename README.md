# @jeffpalmer/genart-platforms

This is an abstraction layer that insulates my generative art code from platform specifics. 

This is intended to be used in conjunction with @jeffpalmer/genart-random, which provides random
number generation tools that ensure there will be no accidental usage of the system random number
generator.
